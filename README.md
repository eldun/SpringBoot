This is just a little repo following the Spring guide that can be found [here](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest).



> Throughout this tutorial, you have engaged in various tactics to build REST APIs. As it turns out, REST isn’t just about pretty URIs and returning JSON instead of XML.
>
> Instead, the following tactics help make your services less likely to break existing clients you may or may not control:
>
>    - Don’t remove old fields. Instead, support them.
>    - Use rel-based links so clients don’t have to hard code URIs.
>    - Retain old links as long as possible. Even if you have to change the URI, keep the rels so older clients have a path onto the newer features.
>    - Use links, not payload data, to instruct clients when various state-driving operations are available.
